# WRI Mapping Framework

This framework provides default styling and some common mapping and interface functionality to incorporate into your projects. It provides a layout which includes default typography, space for the required branding and partner information, common map function buttons (home, zoom in, zoom out), an integrated search bar, and controls for defining map options.

## Files Provided

- **index.html** - A "kitchen sink" framework outline you can use as a starting point in your project. It includes demo elements of various types, and all of the default page elements.
- **wri-map.css** - The framework's default stylesheet, defining the layout and all the elements used. This file has no external styling dependencies.
- **js/wri-map.js** - The framework's default JavaScript library, which operates as a jQuery plugin. It implements the functionality necessary for all the built-in elements. Instructions for customization are available below.
